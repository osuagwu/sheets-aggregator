# Sheets aggregator
The VB script within the Microsoft Excel files lets you aggregate multiple excel sheets into one master sheet. The rows are assigned unique codes with duplicates given the same code by checking for repeats of values in defined columns.
## How to use
The codes are embedded in the Microsoft Excel files **example.xls** and **test.xlsm**. A button is provided to run the examples. The VB code can be accessed in the normal way.
